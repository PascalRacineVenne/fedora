# Fedora

This project was about taking an existing design and reproducing it using some specific tools.

`React / Sass`

Access the project deployment with [Fedora](https://pascalracinevenne.github.io/fedora/).

The source of inspiration is: [Milana](https://www.behance.net/gallery/143271429/Milana-E-commerce-Web?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cmilana)

## Production State

At this stage of the project, I was able to implement a desktop and mobile version, but the tablet version remains to be done.

For the moment there is no connection to a BACK-END to get specific information on each product.
